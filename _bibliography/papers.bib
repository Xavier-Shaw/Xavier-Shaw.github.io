  title={On the Feasibility of Reasoning about the Internal States of Blackbox IoT Devices Using Side-Channel Information},
  author={Wei Sun* and Yuwei Xiao* and Haojian Jin and Dinesh Bharadia},
  abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) devices are typically designed to function in a secure, closed environment, making it difficult for users to comprehend devices' behaviors. This paper shows that a user can leverage side-channel information to reason fine-grained internal states of black box IoT devices. The key enablers for our design are a multi-model sensing technique that fuses power consumption, network traffic, and radio emanations and an annotation interface that helps users form mental models of a black box IoT system. We built a prototype of our design and evaluated the prototype with open-source IoT devices and black-box commercial devices. Our experiments show a false positive rate of 1.44% for open-source IoT devices' state probing, and our participants take an average of 19.8 minutes to reason the internal states of black-box IoT devices.},
