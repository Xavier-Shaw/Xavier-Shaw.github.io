<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

I am a first-year CS PhD student at UCLA advised by [Prof. Eunice Jun](https://eunicemjun.com).

My research interests lie in the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction, Information Visualization, and Data Science. Specifically, I design interactive systems that help individuals understand complex information, uncover subtle insights, and make informed decisions. Currently, I am developing an interactive elicitation approach to support experts in effectively and accurately expressing their domain knowledge in statistical analysis.

Previously, I was luckily advised by [Prof. Haojian Jin](http://shift-3.com) at UCSD. And I earned my bachelor degree from [Southern University of Science and Technology](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/).
